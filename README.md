# Airbnb-Market-Analysis

Course: INF 385T Presenting Information

### Description

I conduct the short-term rental market research with [Airbnb open data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Airbnb already has great success in North America and Europe, in my research, I want to know if Airbnb will have a great business in China as bfore. 

In the report, I find there are three main factors which creates the different markets we know in New York and Beijing. Also, the ratios of the numbers of hosts and rooms in two cities are very diffenent. And, I compare the number of reviews and the number of average price per night. Last, according to Reuters, Airbnb's competitor raised 300 million dollar fomr Jack Ma.
